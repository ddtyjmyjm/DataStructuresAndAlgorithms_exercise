Notes (what the above indicates):

For the ascending oder list, common insert method like always inserting at the leaves 
or at the root will create deepest trees (all of its nodes only have one child ). It's 
also easy to understand that these search operations that cost a lot. Inserting using 
the Splay Tree approach will create the same tree, but when search the key, it will "splay" 
the tree, making the tree more balanced.So the cost of it is not high.

It is good to insert prefix order list at list, so the depth of tree and cost of search 
are not high. But inserting new values at the root is still not doing very well (Half of 
its nodes only have one child). Inserting using the splay tree approach is aslo create the 
deepest tree.

For random list, every approaches of insertion will not create extreme trees. On the whole, the 
result of these are better than others.

VAL trees always have best tree and minimum cost of search. Cause it rebalances the tree at every
inserting. So the time of search is always O(logN).
